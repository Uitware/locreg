# üöÄ‚òÅÔ∏è ```locreg``` - streamline your cloud-native registryless development 

Serverless container runtimes like AWS ECS, Azure App Service for Containers, GCP Cloud Run, etc. are extremely popular nowadays, but deployment of these resources always require to spin up a container runtime resource, as well a separate cloud-based container registry, manually, via proprietary CLI tool, or using IaC tools. 

```locreg``` enables **registryless** approach for serverless applications deployment - you need just a single simple configuration file and locreg binary installed. It: 

- üìç spins up a **local** container registry
- üõ†Ô∏è **builds** the container image and **pushes** to local registry
- üåê spins up a **temporary tunnel** to expose local registry to the Internet (Ngrok is supported for now, Cloudflared coming soon)
- üöÄ deploys a serverless container runtime resource (Azure App Service supported for now, AWS ECS and GCP Cloud Run coming soon)
- üîë passes the credentials of publicly exposed local registry to serverless container runtime resource to streamline the deployment 

 **Your application is up and running on a cloud serverless platform! üéâ** Now you can easily **rebuild** and **redeploy** your application using ```locreg```, and **when the testing is done - easily destroy both local and cloud resources via ```locreg```**!

All configuration is defined and controlled via single ```locreg.yaml``` file - please see ```config_example.yaml``` in the repo root.

## ```locreg``` installation

Currently supported platforms include only Linux amd64. 
We're planning to add MacOS ARM and Linux ARM support soon.
There are several ways to install locreg:


#### Prerequisites
For locreg to work properly, you must have **Docker installed on your machine**
you can do this by following [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
Also, **Ngrok account must be created** you can do this in [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/).
Additionally, if you plan to use locreg with Azure, ensure that the **Azure CLI
is installed** and you have authenticated.
Here you can find how to install it [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

#### Go install

With Go 1.22+, build and install the latest released version:

```go install github.com/Uitware/locreg@latest```

#### Bash script

Use the following Bash script to install locreg from Github Releases:

```
curl -OL https://github.com/Uitware/locreg/releases/latest/download/locreg.tar.gz
tar -zxvf locreg.tar.gz
chmod +x locreg
sudo mv locreg /usr/local/bin/locreg

# remove tarball after installation: 
rm locreg.tar.gz
```

## ```locreg``` usage

Use ```locreg --help``` to display usage info.

## Base scenario - local registry
If you want to use `locreg` to create a local registry, and make it publicly available via Ngrok, you can use the following commands:
First prepare locreg.yaml file that is stored in same directory as your Docker file or where your project is located
with the following content:

```yaml
registry:
  port: 8080 # If omitted, default value 5000 will be assigned.
  username: "locreg" # If omitted, a randomly generated value will be assigned.
  password: "locreg" # If omitted, a randomly generated value will be assigned.

image:
  name: "sample-app" # Set your desired image name, if omitted, default value locreg-built-image will be assigned.
  tag: "latest"  # Set your desired image tag, if omitted, it will be set to your latest commit SHA, if no .git folder then it will be set to "latest".

tunnel:
  provider:
    ngrok:
      name: my-locreg-test # Set your desired name, if omitted, default value locreg-ngrok will be assigned.
      port: 5050 # Set your desired port number, if omitted, default value 4040 will be assigned.
      networkName: ngrok-network # Set your desired network name, if omitted, default value locreg-ngrok will be assigned.
```
> If you want better understanding of default values, then read - [locreg.yaml configuration options in docs](https://uitware.github.io/locreg/configuration/)

After that run command ``locreg registry`` - to start a local container registry and establish a ngrok tunnel for public access.
Now your registry is set up, and you can push your image to it with `locreg push .` command.

Commands: 

- ```deploy``` - creates a serverless container runtime resource with a specified cloud provider and deploys your application. Use this command with a provider (e.g., `azure`) and optionally specify an environment file using --env and the path to a .env file.
```
locreg deploy azure --env path/to/envfile
```

- ```push``` - build from the specified directory that contains Dockerfile for your container image and push the image to your local registry
```
locreg push path/to/dockerfile
```
- ```registry``` - start a local container registry
```
locreg registry
```
- ```tunnel``` - spin up a tunnel to expose local container registry to the public Internet
```
locreg tunnel
```
- ```destroy``` - removes resources created by locreg
  - `registry`: Destroys the local container registry.
  - `tunnel`: Destroys the public access tunnel.
  - `cloud`: Destroys cloud resources (e.g., serverless instances).
  - `all`: Destroys all resources, including registry, tunnel, and cloud resources.
```  
locreg destroy all
locreg destroy registry
  ```
## üìÑ ```locreg``` concepts

locreg uses ```locreg.yaml``` as a source of truth for development environment that it creates. Configuration should include a single registry backend, a single application backend and a single tunnel backend.

üóÉÔ∏è Registry backend (reference ```distribution``` registry is used by default: https://distribution.github.io/distribution/)

```
registry:
  port: 5555 # Port on which the local registry will run, if omitted, default value 5000 will be assigned.
  tag: "2" # Tag for the Docker registry image, if omitted, default value 2 will be assigned.
  image: "registry" # Docker image to use for the local registry, if omitted, default value registry will be assigned.
  name: "my-registry" # Name for the local registry container, if omitted, default value locreg-registry will be assigned.
  username: "myUsername" # Username for accessing the registry, if omitted, a randomly generated value will be assigned.
  password: "myPassword" # Password for accessing the registry, if omitted, a randomly generated value will be assigned.
```

üñºÔ∏è Image configuration
defines the name and tag for the Docker image that will be built and deployed.

```
image:
  name: "locreg-app" # Name of the Docker image to build and deploy, if omitted, default value locreg-built-image will be assigned.
  tag: "latest" # Tag for the Docker image (e.g., latest, v1.0.0), if omitted, it will be set to your latest commit SHA, if git is not initialised then it will be set to "latest".
```

üåê Tunnel backend configuratio (Ngrok by default)

```
tunnel:
  provider:
    ngrok:
      name: "my-locreg-test" # Name for the Ngrok tunnel instance, if omitted, default value locreg-ngrok will be assigned.
      port: 5050 # Port on which the Ngrok tunnel will run, if omitted, default value 4040 will be assigned.
      networkName: "ngrok-network" # Name of the Docker network to which the Ngrok tunnel container will connect, if omitted, default value locreg-ngrok will be assigned.
```

> **_NOTE:_** that you should export ```NGROK_AUTHTOKEN``` in order to use Ngrok tunnel backend: 


‚òÅÔ∏è Application backend (configuration of the serverless cloud runtime resource) example:

      appServicePlan:
        name: "LocregAppServicePlan" # Name of the App Service Plan, if omitted, default value LocregAppServicePlan will be assigned.
        sku:
          name: "B1" # Pricing tier (SKU) for the App Service Plan, if omitted, default value F1 will be assigned.
